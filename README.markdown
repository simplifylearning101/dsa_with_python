# 10-Week Coding Interview Preparation Course: Mastering Data Structures and Algorithms with Python

Welcome to this 10-week course designed to prepare you for coding interviews and help you master data structures and algorithms (DSA) using Python. We don't assume you have any prior knowledge — we'll start from the basics and build up gradually.

Each day, you'll get detailed lessons with code examples, and to build your skills through practice, you'll receive 10-15 homework programs of increasing complexity on the topics covered. These will reinforce what you've learned and help you apply it. Additionally, I'll guide you to practice problems on platforms like LeetCode or NeetCode, selecting relevant ones to match the week's focus. By the end of this course, you'll be confident in solving interview-level problems and explaining your thought process clearly.

## This course is offered in two modes
|   | Cohort Mode (FREE)  | Classroom Mode (Fee based)  |
|---|---|---|
| Course Content | Access to full course content | Access to full course content |
| Course Delivery | Self study mode | You attend Online Classes to accelerate your learning |
| Effectiveness  | Depends on your seriousness | Acitve follow-up from mentor |
| Support & Mentoring  | Basic support | Priority support |
| Payment | ZERO | Minimal, please check with course coodinator |

## Overview of this program:

- Goal: Master DSA using Python for coding interviews.
- Approach: Refer the roadmap below

## Approach
- There would be online sessions 2-3 times (of 1-1.5 hrs) per week going thru this content, doubt clearning. This is for paid members only.
- You will then practice 10-15 homework programs of increasing difficulty on the topics discussed on daily basis. 
- You will slowly start practicing LeetCode/NeetCode problems every week, focusing on easy-to-medium difficulty initially.
- Weekly fun project: At the end of the week, you will develop a mini-project to apply what you've learned, showcasing your understanding (e.g., via GitHub submission). 

## Before we start
- you should have a local environement to practice programs. 
- you should have a github account to showcase your progress.

## Roadmap of the course
The course is structured as follows: Week 0 covers Python fundamentals to ensure a strong foundation. Week 1 dives into advanced Python concepts to make you efficient with the language. Weeks 2 through 9 focus on core DSA topics, building from simpler structures to more advanced algorithms, with plenty of interview-style practice.

| Week | Theme | 
|---|---|
| 0 | [Python Fundamentals](Week0%20Python%20Fundamentals/README.markdown) |
| 1 | [Advanced Concepts in Python](Week1%20Advanced%20Python/README.markdown) |
| 2 | [Arrays and Strings] |
| 3 | [Linked Lists, Stacks, and Queues] |
| 4 | [Trees and Binary Search Trees] |
| 5 | [Graphs] |
| 6 | [Sorting and Searching Algorithms] |
| 7 | [Dynamic Programming] |
| 8 | [Hashing and Heaps] |
| 9 | [Advanced Topics, Review, and Mock Interviews] |
| 10 | [Mock Interviews (PAID MEMBERS ONLY)] |


By following this roadmap, you'll gain the skills to ace coding interviews. Practice consistently, review your mistakes, and reach out if you need help—let's make you an expert!
