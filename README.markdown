# 10-Week Coding Interview Preparation Course: Mastering Data Structures and Algorithms with Python

Welcome to this 10-week course designed to prepare you for coding interviews and help you master data structures and algorithms (DSA) using Python. We don't assume you have any prior knowledge — we'll start from the basics and build up gradually.

Each day, you'll get detailed lessons with code examples, and to build your skills through practice, you'll receive 10-15 homework programs of increasing complexity on the topics covered. These will reinforce what you've learned and help you apply it. Additionally, I'll guide you to practice problems on platforms like LeetCode or NeetCode, selecting relevant ones to match the week's focus. By the end of this course, you'll be confident in solving interview-level problems and explaining your thought process clearly.

## This course is offered in two modes
|   | Cohort Mode (FREE)  | Classroom Mode (Fee based)  |
|---|---|---|
| Course Content | Access to full course content | Access to full course content |
| Course Delivery | Self study mode | You attend Online Classes to accelerate your learning |
| Effectiveness  | Depends on your seriousness | Acitve follow-up from mentor |
| Support & Mentoring  | Basic support | Priority support |
| Payment | ZERO | Minimal, please check with course coodinator |

## Overview of this program:

- Goal: Master DSA using Python for coding interviews.
- Approach: Refer the roadmap below

## Approach
- There would be online sessions 2-3 times (of 1-1.5 hrs) per week going thru this content, doubt clearning. This is for paid members only.
- You will then practice 10-15 homework programs of increasing difficulty on the topics discussed on daily basis. 
- You will slowly start practicing LeetCode/NeetCode problems every week, focusing on easy-to-medium difficulty initially.
- Weekly fun project: At the end of the week, you will develop a mini-project to apply what you've learned, showcasing your understanding (e.g., via GitHub submission). 

## Before we start
- you should have a local environement to practice programs. 
- you should have a github account to showcase your progress.

## Week 0: Python Fundamentals
This week sets the base for everything. If you're new to programming or need a refresher, you'll start here to get comfortable with Python's basics. You'll learn how to think like a programmer, write simple scripts, and debug code.

Key topics you'll cover:
- Introduction to Python: Installing Python, using the interpreter, and writing your first "Hello, World!" program.
- Variables, data types (integers, floats, strings, booleans), and basic operations (arithmetic, comparison).
- Control structures: If-else statements, loops (for and while), and breaking/continuing loops.
- Functions: Defining functions, parameters, return values, and scope.
- Basic data structures: Lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries—creating, accessing, and modifying them.
- Input/output: Reading from console, writing to files, and handling simple errors.
- String manipulation and basic built-in functions.


## Week 1: Advanced Concepts in Python
Building on fundamentals, you'll explore Python's powerful features to write cleaner, faster code—essential for efficient interview solutions.

Key topics you'll cover:
- List comprehensions, generators, and iterators for concise data handling.
- Advanced functions: Lambda functions, map/filter/reduce, decorators, and recursion.
- Object-oriented programming: Classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.
- Error handling: Try-except blocks, custom exceptions, and debugging techniques.
- Modules and packages: Importing libraries, creating your own modules.
- File handling advanced: Reading/writing CSV/JSON, context managers (with statements).
- Time and space complexity basics: Big O notation introduction with Python examples.

## Week 2: Arrays and Strings
You'll kick off DSA with foundational structures. Arrays (lists in Python) and strings are common in interviews, so you'll learn manipulation techniques.

Key topics you'll cover:
- Array operations: Indexing, slicing, insertion/deletion, searching.
- Two-pointer technique, sliding windows.
- String operations: Concatenation, substring search, reversal.
- Common problems: Anagrams, palindromes, longest substring without repeats.
- Time/space optimization for array/string problems.

## Week 3: Linked Lists, Stacks, and Queues
You'll move to dynamic structures. These are key for understanding memory and operations like add/remove.

Key topics you'll cover:
- Linked lists: Singly/doubly linked, traversal, reversal, cycle detection.
- Stacks: Push/pop, applications like parentheses validation.
- Queues: Enqueue/dequeue, priority queues, BFS basics.
- Deques in Python for efficient implementations.

## Week 4: Trees and Binary Search Trees
You'll explore hierarchical structures, crucial for search and organization.

Key topics you'll cover:
- Tree basics: Nodes, roots, leaves, traversal (in-order, pre-order, post-order).
- Binary trees: Construction, height, diameter.
- Binary Search Trees (BST): Insertion, deletion, search, balancing intro.
- Common problems: Lowest common ancestor, validate BST.

## Week 5: Graphs
You'll tackle connected structures, used in networks and paths.

Key topics you'll cover:
- Graph representations: Adjacency list/matrix.
- Traversal: DFS, BFS.
- Shortest paths: Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford.
- Cycles, connected components, topological sort.

## Week 6: Sorting and Searching Algorithms
You'll learn efficient ways to order and find data.

Key topics you'll cover:
- Sorting: Bubble, selection, insertion, merge, quick, heap sort.
- Searching: Binary search, exponential search.
- Variations: Sort with duplicates, search in rotated array.

## Week 7: Dynamic Programming
You'll master optimization techniques for overlapping subproblems.

Key topics you'll cover:
- Memoization vs. tabulation.
- 1D DP: Fibonacci, climbing stairs.
- 2D DP: Knapsack, longest common subsequence.
- Advanced: House robber, edit distance.

## Week 8: Hashing and Heaps
You'll cover fast lookups and priority-based structures.

- Heaps: Min/max heaps, heapify, priority queues.
- Applications: Top K elements, merge K lists.

## Week 9: Advanced Topics, Review, and Mock Interviews
You'll tie everything together with advanced concepts and practice interviews.

Key topics you'll cover:
- Bit manipulation: AND/OR/XOR, bit shifting.
- Greedy algorithms: Interval scheduling, fractional knapsack.
