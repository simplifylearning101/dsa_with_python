# 10-Week Coding Interview Preparation Course: Mastering Data Structures and Algorithms with Python

Welcome to this 10-week cohort designed to prepare you for coding interviews and help you master data structures and algorithms (DSA) using Python. As your mentor with over two decades of teaching experience in computer science, I focus on simplifying complex ideas with clear, simple English explanations. We'll break down every concept step by step, using example programs filled with comments to show exactly what each line of code does. I don't assume you have any prior knowledge—we'll start from the basics and build up gradually.

Each day, you'll get detailed lessons with code examples, and to build your skills through practice, you'll receive 10-15 homework programs of increasing complexity on the topics covered. These will reinforce what you've learned and help you apply it. Additionally, I'll guide you to practice problems on platforms like LeetCode or NeetCode, selecting relevant ones to match the week's focus. By the end of this course, you'll be confident in solving interview-level problems and explaining your thought process clearly.

The course is structured as follows: Week 0 covers Python fundamentals to ensure a strong foundation. Week 1 dives into advanced Python concepts to make you efficient with the language. Weeks 2 through 9 focus on core DSA topics, building from simpler structures to more advanced algorithms, with plenty of interview-style practice.

## Week 0: Python Fundamentals
This week sets the base for everything. If you're new to programming or need a refresher, you'll start here to get comfortable with Python's basics. You'll learn how to think like a programmer, write simple scripts, and debug code.

Key topics you'll cover:
- Introduction to Python: Installing Python, using the interpreter, and writing your first "Hello, World!" program.
- Variables, data types (integers, floats, strings, booleans), and basic operations (arithmetic, comparison).
- Control structures: If-else statements, loops (for and while), and breaking/continuing loops.
- Functions: Defining functions, parameters, return values, and scope.
- Basic data structures: Lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries—creating, accessing, and modifying them.
- Input/output: Reading from console, writing to files, and handling simple errors.
- String manipulation and basic built-in functions.

Each day, you'll see concepts explained with commented code examples, like this simple one for loops:

```python
# This program demonstrates a basic for loop to print numbers from 1 to 5
for i in range(1, 6):  # range(1,6) generates numbers 1 through 5
    print(i)  # Print the current number
    # End of loop - it repeats 5 times
```

**Homework**: 10-15 programs daily, starting simple (e.g., calculate sum of numbers) and building to moderate (e.g., reverse a list). You'll also solve 5-10 easy LeetCode problems on basics, like "Fizz Buzz" or "Palindrome Number."

## Week 1: Advanced Concepts in Python
Building on fundamentals, you'll explore Python's powerful features to write cleaner, faster code—essential for efficient interview solutions.

Key topics you'll cover:
- List comprehensions, generators, and iterators for concise data handling.
- Advanced functions: Lambda functions, map/filter/reduce, decorators, and recursion.
- Object-oriented programming: Classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.
- Error handling: Try-except blocks, custom exceptions, and debugging techniques.
- Modules and packages: Importing libraries, creating your own modules.
- File handling advanced: Reading/writing CSV/JSON, context managers (with statements).
- Time and space complexity basics: Big O notation introduction with Python examples.

Example code with comments for a lambda function:

```python
# This shows a lambda function to square numbers in a list
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]  # Our input list
squared = list(map(lambda x: x ** 2, numbers))  # lambda x: x**2 is an anonymous function; map applies it to each element
print(squared)  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16]
# Lambdas are great for short, one-time functions
```

**Homework**: 10-15 programs, from list comprehensions (e.g., filter even numbers) to OOP (e.g., build a simple bank account class). Practice 10-15 LeetCode problems on Python-specific tricks, like "Valid Parentheses" using stacks via lists.

## Week 2: Arrays and Strings
You'll kick off DSA with foundational structures. Arrays (lists in Python) and strings are common in interviews, so you'll learn manipulation techniques.

Key topics you'll cover:
- Array operations: Indexing, slicing, insertion/deletion, searching.
- Two-pointer technique, sliding windows.
- String operations: Concatenation, substring search, reversal.
- Common problems: Anagrams, palindromes, longest substring without repeats.
- Time/space optimization for array/string problems.

Example code for two-pointer sum:

```python
# Find two numbers in a sorted array that add up to target using two pointers
def two_sum(nums, target):
    left = 0  # Start pointer at beginning
    right = len(nums) - 1  # End pointer at last index
    while left < right:  # Loop until pointers meet
        current_sum = nums[left] + nums[right]  # Calculate sum
        if current_sum == target:  # If match, return indices
            return [left, right]
        elif current_sum < target:  # Too small? Move left pointer right
            left += 1
        else:  # Too big? Move right pointer left
            right -= 1
    return []  # No solution found
```

**Homework**: 10-15 programs, e.g., rotate array, find duplicates. Solve 15-20 LeetCode easy/medium problems like "Two Sum" or "Longest Palindromic Substring."

## Week 3: Linked Lists, Stacks, and Queues
You'll move to dynamic structures. These are key for understanding memory and operations like add/remove.

Key topics you'll cover:
- Linked lists: Singly/doubly linked, traversal, reversal, cycle detection.
- Stacks: Push/pop, applications like parentheses validation.
- Queues: Enqueue/dequeue, priority queues, BFS basics.
- Deques in Python for efficient implementations.

Example for linked list reversal:

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list node
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val  # Node value
        self.next = next  # Pointer to next node

# Reverse a linked list
def reverse_list(head):
    prev = None  # Previous node starts as None
    current = head  # Start at head
    while current:  # Traverse list
        next_temp = current.next  # Save next node
        current.next = prev  # Reverse pointer
        prev = current  # Move prev forward
        current = next_temp  # Move current forward
    return prev  # New head is prev
```

**Homework**: 10-15 programs, e.g., merge lists, implement stack. Practice 15-20 LeetCode problems like "Reverse Linked List" or "Valid Parentheses."

## Week 4: Trees and Binary Search Trees
You'll explore hierarchical structures, crucial for search and organization.

Key topics you'll cover:

- Binary trees: Construction, height, diameter.
- Binary Search Trees (BST): Insertion, deletion, search, balancing intro.
- Common problems: Lowest common ancestor, validate BST.

Example for in-order traversal:

```python
# Tree node class
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

# In-order traversal (left-root-right)
def inorder_traversal(root):
    result = []  # List to store values
    def helper(node):  # Recursive helper
        if node:  # If node exists
            helper(node.left)  # Traverse left
            result.append(node.val)  # Add root
            helper(node.right)  # Traverse right
    helper(root)  # Start recursion
    return result
```

**Homework**: 10-15 programs, e.g., build tree from array. Solve 15-20 LeetCode problems like "Invert Binary Tree" or "Validate BST."

    visited = set()  # Track visited nodes
    queue = deque([start])  # Initialize queue
    visited.add(start)  # Mark start as visited
    while queue:  # While queue not empty
        node = queue.popleft()  # Dequeue node
        print(node)  # Process node (e.g., print)
        for neighbor in graph[node]:  # For each neighbor
            if neighbor not in visited:  # If not visited
                visited.add(neighbor)  # Mark visited
                queue.append(neighbor)  # Enqueue
```

    while left <= right:  # While search space exists
        mid = (left + right) // 2  # Middle index
        if nums[mid] == target:  # Found? Return index
            return mid
        elif nums[mid] < target:  # Too small? Search right
            left = mid + 1
        else:  # Too big? Search left

    if n in memo:  # If already computed
        return memo[n]
    if n <= 1:  # Base case
        return n
