**Problem:** Create a list of 5 fruits.

**Outcome:** A Python list containing five different fruit names as strings.

**Example:** `['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'date', 'elderberry']`

---

**Problem:** Access the second and last elements of a list.

**Outcome:** Print the values of the element at index 1 and the last element of the list.

**Example:**
* List: `[10, 20, 30, 40]`
* Output: `20` and `40`

---

**Problem:** Create a string with your full name. Access and print your first initial and your last initial using positive and negative indexing.

**Outcome:** Your first and last initials are printed to the console.

**Example:**
* String: `"John Doe"`
* Output: `J` and `e`

---

**Problem:** Slice a string to create a new string containing only the first three characters.

**Outcome:** A new string with the first three characters.

**Example:**
* String: `"Python"`
* Output: `"Pyt"`

---

**Problem:** Given a list, create a new list containing only the elements from the middle of the original list.

**Outcome:** A new list containing elements from index 2 to index 5 (inclusive).

**Example:**
* List: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`
* Output: `[3, 4, 5, 6]`

---

**Problem:** Use a string slicing trick to reverse a string.

**Outcome:** A new string that is the reverse of the original.

**Example:**
* String: `"hello"`
* Output: `"olleh"`

---

**Problem:** Append a new number to an existing list of numbers.

**Outcome:** The original list is modified in-place with the new number at the end.

**Example:**
* List: `[1, 2, 3]`
* Append: `4`
* New List: `[1, 2, 3, 4]`

---

**Problem:** Given a list of names, remove the name "Bob".

**Outcome:** The list no longer contains "Bob". Use `list.remove()`.

**Example:**
* List: `['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie']`
* New List: `['Alice', 'Charlie']`

---

**Problem:** Create a function that takes a list of numbers and returns a new list where each number is squared. Use a loop to iterate through the list.

**Outcome:** A new list with all numbers squared.

**Example:**
* Input: `[1, 2, 3, 4]`
* Output: `[1, 4, 9, 16]`

---

**Problem:** Given a string, check if it's a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards).

**Outcome:** A boolean value (`True` or `False`). You can use string slicing to help.

**Example:**
* Input: `"racecar"` -> `True`
* Input: `"hello"` -> `False`

---

**Problem:** Given a list, insert a new element at the beginning of the list.

**Outcome:** The list is modified with the new element at index 0.

**Example:**
* List: `[10, 20]`
* Insert: `5`
* New List: `[5, 10, 20]`

---

**Problem:** Given a list of numbers, sort it in ascending order and then in descending order.

**Outcome:** The list is sorted first in ascending, then in descending order.

**Example:**
* Input: `[5, 1, 9, 3]`
* After ascending sort: `[1, 3, 5, 9]`
* After descending sort: `[9, 5, 3, 1]`

---

**Problem:** Take a list and a specific value. Check if the value exists in the list using the `in` operator.

**Outcome:** Print `True` if the value is in the list, `False` otherwise.

**Example:**
* List: `['a', 'b', 'c']`, Value: `'b'` -> `True`
* List: `['x', 'y', 'z']`, Value: `'d'` -> `False`

---

**Problem:** Given a sentence as a string, count how many times the letter 'a' appears.

**Outcome:** The total count of 'a's. Use a loop.

**Example:**
* String: `"apple and a banana"`
* Output: `5`
