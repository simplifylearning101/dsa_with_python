# Solutions to Hour 1 Homework Problems

Here are the solutions with commented code.

Problem 1:
```python
# Simple print statement
print("Welcome to Python!")  # Output: Welcome to Python!
```

Problem 2:
```python
# String variable
name = "Bob"  # Assign name
print(name)  # Output: Bob
```

Problem 3:
```python
# Integer variable in sentence
age = 25  # Assign age
print("I am " + str(age) + " years old.")  # Output: I am 25 years old. (Note: str() to concatenate)
```

Problem 4:
```python
# Float with print
height = 1.75  # Assign height
print(height)  # Output: 1.75 (Python prints floats as is)
```

Problem 5:
```python
# Boolean
is_student = True  # Assign boolean
print(is_student)  # Output: True
```

Problem 6:
```python
# Reassign type
var = 10  # Int
print(var)  # Output: 10
var = "10"  # Now str
print(var)  # Output: 10 (but as string)
```

Problem 7:
```python
# Types
print(type(42))  # <class 'int'>
print(type(3.14))  # <class 'float'>
print(type("Hi"))  # <class 'str'>
print(type(True))  # <class 'bool'>
```

Problem 8:
```python
# Multiple variables
name = "Alice"
age = 30
height = 1.65
print(name + " is " + str(age) + " years old and " + str(height) + "m tall.")  # Output: Alice is 30 years old and 1.65m tall.
```

Problem 9:
```python
# Conversion
num_str = "100"  # String
num_int = int(num_str)  # Convert to int
result = num_int + 50  # Add
print(result)  # Output: 150
```

Problem 10:
```python
# Boolean from comparison
comparison = 5 > 3  # True
print(comparison)  # Output: True
```
