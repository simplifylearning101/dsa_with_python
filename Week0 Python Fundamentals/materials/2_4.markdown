## Solutions for the Quiz
1. Floor division (integer result).  
2. 1 (remainder).  
3. Logical operator, both True.  
4. `if num < 0: print("Negative")`  
5. For: known iterations; while: condition-based.  
6. Exits loop.  
7. False (5<3 is False).  
8. 1,2,3,4 (excludes 5).  
9. False, required.  
10. Infinite loop (no increment).  
11. `for i in range(1, 4): print(i)`  
12. Skips to next iteration.  
13. 8.  
14. `if num > 10: print("Greater"); else: print("Not greater")`  
15. Stops evaluating at first False (and) or True (or).  
16. `for i in range(2, 9, 2): print(i)`  
17. Not equal.  
18. Standard, readable.  
19. True (value equality).  
20. `i = 5; while i >= 1: print(i); i -= 1`  
21. Division rounding down to integer.  
22. `if x > 0 and x < 10 or x == 20: print("Valid")`
