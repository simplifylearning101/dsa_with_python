# Hour 1 Homework: Practice Problems

Practice these 10 programs to reinforce introduction, variables, and data types. Start simple and build complexity. Write each as a .py file, run them, and check outputs.

Problem 1:  
Outcome: Print a welcome message using print().  
Example: Output: "Welcome to Python!"

Problem 2:  
Outcome: Create a variable for your name (string) and print it.  
Example: name = "Bob" → Output: "Bob"

Problem 3:  
Outcome: Create an integer variable for age and print "I am [age] years old."  
Example: age = 25 → Output: "I am 25 years old."

Problem 4:  
Outcome: Create a float for height in meters and print it with two decimals.  
Example: height = 1.75 → Output: 1.75

Problem 5:  
Outcome: Create a boolean is_student and print if you are a student.  
Example: is_student = True → Output: True

Problem 6:  
Outcome: Reassign a variable from int to string and print both times.  
Example: var = 10 → "10" (print twice)

Problem 7:  
Outcome: Use type() to print types of an int, float, str, bool.  
Example: Output: <class 'int'>, etc.

Problem 8:  
Outcome: Create variables for name, age, height; print in one sentence.  
Example: "Alice is 30 years old and 1.65m tall."

Problem 9:  
Outcome: Convert a string "100" to int and add 50, print result.  
Example: Output: 150

Problem 10:  
Outcome: Create a boolean from comparison (e.g., 5 > 3) and print it.  
Example: Output: True
